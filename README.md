# Paleo Store
An app that displays paleo compliant foods.

## Description
This a recreation of Mozilla Developer Network's "The Can Store" example app - [repository link](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/master/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store).

I modified the app so that it displays paleo compliant foods instead of the original canned goods.

I also made a few improvements:
- Removed some global variables.
- Removed array based implementations of filtering and replaced with Array.filter() methods.
